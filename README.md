SUMMARY

Using the Baseball dataset, I wanted to find out how the Player attributes of Height, Weight and Handedness are related to Home Runs.   My initial guess that I wanted to test is that greater Height, Lower Weight, and Right Handedness each contributed to mmore Home Runs on average.  

To determine the actual relationship between Height, Weight or Handedness and Home Runs, I divided the Height and Weight data ranges into three assigned categories representing Low/Average/High Height or Weight, and calculated the Home Run average for all Players in each category.  I also calculated the Home Run average for each of the Handedness categories.


DESIGN

I chose to use a bar chart, since this is a very clear way to highlight any differences between categorical variables.  I displayed the categories for each attribute along the x-axis, and the Home Run average for all Players for each category along the measurement/y-axis.
